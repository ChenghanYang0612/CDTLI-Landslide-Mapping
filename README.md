## Methodology Overview  

The study introduces a **tri-temporal logical information framework** for co-seismic landslide mapping in vegetated areas.  
By jointly analyzing pre-seismic, co-seismic, and post-seismic imagery, the approach suppresses vegetation-induced noise and improves detection reliability.

**Key contributions:**  
- A logical inference strategy to incorporate temporal consistency.  
- Enhanced robustness in vegetated mountain environments.  
- Integration of ensemble learning for improved mapping accuracy.  
- Comprehensive validation across multiple earthquake events.
